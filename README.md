## A Tribute To Mike Pondsmith

I want to dedicate this website to one of my inspirations, Mr. Michael Alyn Pondsimth, also known as Mike Pondsmith, famous for his board game Cyberpunk (1988), which is becoming a video game Cyberpunk 2077. One of the genre innovators contributing to video games, board games, and design aesthetics we associate with the genre. The tribute page summarizes Mike's career and the upcoming game in collaboration with CD Project Red.
