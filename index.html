   <h2 id="tribute-info"> Where It All Began</h2>
   <button class="accordion">EARLY LIFE</button>
   <div class="panel">
     <p>Born to a psychologist and military air force officer, he often found himself globetrotting under the American banner in his youth. However, Mike Pondsmith's imagination enabled him to craft games in his spare time as a child. Eventually, it led him to his passion. Hence, his introduction to pen and paper role-playing games in college at the <strong><em>University of California, Davis,</strong></em> graduating with a BA in graphic design and a BS in behavioral psychology. His friend gave him a copy of <strong><em>Dungeon and Dragons (D&D)</em></strong>, but the science-fiction role-playing game <strong><em>Traveller</em></strong> published in 1977 piqued his interest.</p>

   <button class="accordion">CAREER</button>
   <div class="panel">
     <p>Before Michael's lustrous career in paper and pen games design Michael worked in the gaming industry. His first job was as a graphic designer for <strong><em>California Pacific Computer Company (CPCC),</em></strong>repackaging Japanese imports for the western market. A few years later, at CPCC, he worked on designs for original titles by Bill Budge, famous for Raster blaster and pinball games. He also did design work for Robert Garriot's Ultima series. Eventually, Pondsmith moved on from CPCC and began managing a typesetting house at the <strong><em>University of California, Santa Cruz.</em></strong></p>
     <p>Due to software limitations, there was not much to do in the early gaming industry. As a result, most of the games CPCC developed were for apple computers; however, Pondsmith started in game design in the 1980s. He designed a personal game called Imperial Star, which he created to improve the combat system in Traveller for his personal use. Mike believed Traveller to be the best role-playing game in the <strong><em>Green Ronin's award-winning Hobby games.</em></strong> He also made a Mecha game based on some Japanese manga he stumbled upon, and he called the game Mekton.</p>
